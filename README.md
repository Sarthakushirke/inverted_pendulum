# inverted_pendulum
The inverted pendulum is a well-known example in the study of dynamics and control theory, often introduced in high school and undergraduate-level physics or mathematics. As someone passionate about math and science, I was inspired to put theory into practice by building my own inverted pendulum. Translating classroom concepts into a real-world project not only deepened my understanding but also introduced me to a new set of practical challenges and considerationsâ€”ones that theoretical exercises often overlook.

ðŸš€ Motor Selection Update
Initially tested with an N20 micro gear motor.

Pros: Compact, lightweight.

Cons: Unable to reverse direction reliably due to internal mechanical resistance.

Attempted to counter resistance by adding external weight.

Resulted in insufficient torque to move the load effectively.

Decision: Switch to the Robstride 00 motor.

Provides higher torque, solving the load-handling issue.

Thanks to the Robotics group (RBT), TU/e for providing access to this motor.

âœ… Outcome: Improved bi-directional motion and torque performance for the application.
