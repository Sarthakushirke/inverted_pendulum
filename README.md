# inverted_pendulum
The inverted pendulum is a well-known example in the study of dynamics and control theory, often introduced in high school and undergraduate-level physics or mathematics. As someone passionate about math and science, I was inspired to put theory into practice by building my own inverted pendulum. Translating classroom concepts into a real-world project not only deepened my understanding but also introduced me to a new set of practical challenges and considerationsâ€”ones that theoretical exercises often overlook.
